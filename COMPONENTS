### EDITOR
Centerpiece tying the other components together and implementing the main structure for FPT Edge Editing algorithms.

- Editor
Lets the finder enumerate forbidden subgraphs and gives them to the consumers. Fetches and handles the results from the consumers. All edges of the selected forbidden subgraph are edited and recursively solved in turn.

- MT
Multithreaded variant of Editor. All threads monitor the size of a shared work queue. If the size falls below a threshold, a thread noticing this gives the unhandled parts of its initial recursion to the queue.

### FINDER
Component that finds forbidden subgraphs.
What is considered a forbidden subgraph is defined by the components themselves; currently either P~4~/C~4~ or P~5~/C~5~ as indicated by the number following the algorithm name.

- Center (Center_4, Center_5)
	Tries each edge (for P~x~/C~x~, x even) resp. vertex (x odd) as the center of a forbidden subgraph. The center is expanded by simultaneously adding an edge to both sides while maintaining that the subgraph is a path (thus transforming a P~y~ to P~y+2~) until the desired length is reached. In the last expansion it is allowed to transform the path (P~y~) into a cycle (C~y+2~) instead.

- Center_Edits (Center_Edits_4, Center_Edits_5)
	Same as Center, but whenever given the choice between edited and unedited edges the edited edges are tried first. The goal is to help greedy lower bound algorithms by finding forbidden subgraphs with many uneditable edges first.

- Center_Edits_Sparse (Center_Edits_Sparse_4, Center_Edits_Sparse_5)
	Same as Center_Edits, but only finds forbidden subgraphs that have no overlap in unedited edges. This allows skipping parts where found forbidden subgraphs will not benefit greedy lower bound algorithms. As consequence, Center_Edits_Sparse will only find some, but not all, forbidden subgraphs


### CONSUMERS
Components that use the forbidden subgraphs produced by a finder, split into three groups:
1. Selectors, choosing a forbidden subgraph for editing
2. Lower bound calculators
3. Others, that do not help the editor but produce some other result or statistic

An algorithm may be part of multiple groups

- **Selectors**:
	- First
		Chooses the first forbidden subgraph found

	- Least
		Chooses the forbidden subgraph with the least amount of unedited edges

	- Most
		Chooses the unedited edge participating in most forbidden subgraphs

- **Lower bound calculators**:
	- No
		pseudo calculator; returns a lower bound of 1 if at least one forbidden subgraph was found

	- Basic
		Calculates a lower bound by collecting non-overlapping forbidden subgraphs; greedy

- **Selectors & Lower bound calculators**:
	- Single
		Lower bound calculation is identical to Basic
		Tests for each unedited edge participating in the lower bound whether editing or marking it increases the lower bound. Selects the edge with the highest increase. If no such edge exits, falls back to the forbidden subgraph with the least amount of unedited edges

- **Other**:
(currently none)


### GRAPHS
Component that stores a graph

- Matrix
	Represents the graph as an adjecenzy matrix


### OPTIONS
These are not algorithm choices, but instead define which edges are considered editable

- **MODES**:
Which problem is to be solved?
	- Edit
		Edge Editing Problem (both inserting and deleting edges are allowed)
	- Delete
		Edge Deletion Problem (edges may only be deleted, not inserted)
	- Insert
		Edge Insertion Problem (edges may only be inserted, not deleted)

- **RESTRICTIONS**:
Prevent edges from being edited based on
	- None
		None of the other restrictions apply
	- Undo
		Editing an edge that is currently considered edited (thus reverting or undoing the edit) is not allowed
	- Redundant
		Editing an edge that would lead to an already explored situation is forbidden

- **CONVERSIONS**:
How is the editing an edge converting a Path to a Cycle and vice versa handled?
	- Normal
		No special treatment
	- Last
		All other edges of the forbidden subgraph are handled first
	- Skip
		The edge will not be edited
